The easiest way to launch the application is to checkout the repository in a
Maven-enabled IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA).

The app is self-contained and will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
after you run it.

There's a possibility to [replace](http://sparkjava.com/documentation#other-web-server)
the underlying embedded Jetty web server with something like Apache Tomcat and
run the app on (for example) [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Java.html).
